      description: >
        This model contains logic for mapping ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes to CCSR categories.

      columns:
          - name: encounter_id
            description: >
              Unique ID for each encounter in the dataset.
          - name: default_ccsr_inpatient
            description: >
              CCSR category that is the default CCSR for inpatient encounters (because a diagnosis code may
              be mapped to multiple CCSRs it's helpful to know the default CCSR assigned to an encounter).
          - name: default_ccsr_outpatient
            description: >
              CCSR category that is the default CCSR for outpatient encounters (because a diagnosis code may
              be mapped to multiple CCSRs it's helpful to know the default CCSR assigned to an encounter).
          - name: ccsr_1
            description: >
              The first CCSR the diagnosis code was mapped to (each diagnosis code can be mapped to up to 6
              CCSR categories).
          - name: ccsr_2
            description: >
              The second CCSR the diagnosis code was mapped to (each diagnosis code can be mapped to up to 6
              CCSR categories).
          - name: ccsr_3
            description: >
              The third CCSR the diagnosis code was mapped to (each diagnosis code can be mapped to up to 6
              CCSR categories).
          - name: ccsr_4
            description: >
              The fourth CCSR the diagnosis code was mapped to (each diagnosis code can be mapped to up to 6
              CCSR categories).
          - name: ccsr_5
            description: >
              The fifth CCSR the diagnosis code was mapped to (each diagnosis code can be mapped to up to 6
              CCSR categories).
          - name: ccsr_6
            description: >
              The sixth CCSR the diagnosis code was mapped to (each diagnosis code can be mapped to up to 6
              CCSR categories).
